# Data Structures and algorithm

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository! 

This repository contains implementations and explanations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in different programming languages. 
It aims to provide a comprehensive collection of well-documented code examples and educational resources to help developers and computer science enthusiasts improve their understanding and problem-solving skills.

# Data structures
The repository covers the following Data Structures:

Arrays and Strings
Linked Lists
Stacks
Queues
Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
Graphs
Hash Tables
Heaps (Min Heap, Max Heap)
Trie
Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
and more...

# Algorithms
Various classic and advanced Algorithms are implemented here, including but not limited to:

Searching (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, etc.)
Sorting (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
Dynamic Programming
Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, Prim's, etc.)
Greedy Algorithms
Backtracking
Divide and Conquer
and more...

Thank you for using and contributing to this DSA repository. Happy coding! If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or contact us.
